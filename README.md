## sharepoint-react-app-boilerplate

A SharePoint App boilerplate for creating React apps

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and enhanced with the following:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static type checking.
- [sp-rest-proxy](https://github.com/koltyakov/sp-rest-proxy) - Provides a proxy to a SharePoint environment for live testing.
- [craco](https://github.com/sharegate/craco) - A package created by the ShareGate to allow configuring CRA without ejecting.
- [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) - Hooks git to perform custom tasks in response to commands.
- [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) - Allows for CI unit tests.
